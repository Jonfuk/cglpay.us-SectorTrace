# Beta Autonomous Development

## Purpose

This file is the persistent journal, decision record, backlog and
machine-readable work queue for autonomous improvement work on the `beta`
branch, per the "Autonomous Beta Development Agent" brief the project owner
supplied on 2026-08-25. It is designed to survive context loss, session
restarts and hand-off to a different agent: read this file, the queue below,
and `git log`, and continue — do not re-derive product discovery from
scratch.

**Read `docs/upgrade-roadmap.md` too.** It is this project's own pre-existing,
much more detailed planning register (findings F/D/P/U/W/O-##, phases 1–19,
an explicit "Rejected" table and "Open questions"). As of 2026-08-25 every
entry in it has been checked against current code and is accurate (see
BETA-002) — it can now be trusted the way it could not at the start of this
file. Its "Rejected" table in particular records settled product decisions
this session must not re-litigate. What it does *not* cover: anything that
shipped outside its own phase system, which by now is most of the project
(Railway, S3 archive, PostgreSQL mirroring, the Ansible VPS deployment,
`m24`–`m28`, this file's own beta-deployment work). That gap is deliberate,
not a defect — see BETA-002's DONE entry for the reasoning.

## Current Beta Status

- `beta` created 2026-08-25 from `master` at `c1c3ecd`, which already
  includes BETA-001 (see its note on why that one commit is on `master`
  directly, not `beta`). `beta` is now at `29d07c9`.
- Three items completed this session: BETA-001 (master), BETA-002, BETA-003.
- Baseline: `uv run python -m pytest` was not run in full this cycle (see
  Testing Decisions) — targeted tests were run for each change instead, all
  green. A future session touching migrations, exports or write paths should
  run it in full first.

## Architectural Summary

Stdlib Python HTTP server (`pipeline/web/server.py`), SQLite by default with
an optional PostgreSQL backend (`DATABASE_URL`), 28 collection modules
(`m00`–`m28`) each writing their own tables, a public evidence portal at `/`
and an operator UI at `/admin`, vanilla JS front ends (no framework, no build
step — see settled decision 6 in `CLAUDE.md`).

**Deployment (updated after BETA-003):** production is **Railway** (per the
project owner directly, and per `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`'s existing "Somewhere
else: Railway" section — this was already documented, just not cross-checked
against `deploy/ansible/` before this session asked). `deploy/ansible/` is a
separate, real, working self-host build (Debian VPS, Docker Compose:
Postgres, Neo4j, app, Caddy) whose live/fallback/unused status relative to
Railway was **not** asked about — the project owner's answer only confirmed
Railway is production, not what `deploy/ansible/` currently is. Not re-opened
speculatively; ask if it matters for future work.

**`deploy/ansible-mirror/` now builds two things**, chosen by its wizard:
the original disaster-recovery mirror (unchanged: read-only, wiped nightly,
"read it, do not work in it"), and a new **beta deployment** mode
(`mirror_role: beta`) that pins a git branch, seeds its database from
production — including Railway, via the sync path already built for exactly
that ("directly from a PostgreSQL URL") — **once**, and is then left as an
ordinary writable database for testing. See BETA-003's DONE entry. **Not yet
exercised against a real VPS** — this dev environment has no `ansible-playbook`
to run it against; validated statically only (syntax, YAML parse, manual
Jinja review). First real run should be watched by a human, per the brief's
own "reduced testing policy" for infrastructure changes.

## Product Direction

Unchanged from the project's own settled framing (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`):
a smaller, defensible evidence base beats a larger, plausible one. This
session found no reason to challenge that, and the original brief's broad
license to "add AI features / entity resolution / new datasets" was
deliberately **not** exercised speculatively — this project already has an
unusually well-reasoned, explicit boundary on exactly those things
(`docs/CAVEATS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` settled decisions 1–10, the roadmap's own
"Rejected" table). Proposing more of that surface without a concrete,
evidenced need would be scope-seeking, not product judgement.

### DONE

- [DONE] BETA-003 | Teach ansible-mirror to build a beta deployment, not just mirror
  - completed: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
  - commits: 29d07c9 (`beta`)
  - result: Project owner confirmed production is Railway directly. Added
    `mirror_role` ("dr_mirror", unchanged default, or "beta") to
    `deploy/ansible-mirror/`: a beta box pins a git branch (`deploy_git_branch`,
    default "beta"), a new `site.yml` pre-task resets the box's checkout to
    `origin/<branch>` before every build, and the database is seeded from a
    source **once** (`mirror_recurring_sync_enabled: false` by default for
    beta — reusing the mirror's existing three sync paths, including "url"
    mode which the docs already described as built for exactly a managed
    source "such as Railway") rather than wholesale-replaced nightly.
    `mirror_verify_enabled` now derives from whether recurring sync is on,
    since "does this still match the source" is meaningless for a database
    meant to diverge via test writes. Wizard, `site.yml`, the role's tasks,
    both READMEs and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` all updated. `bash -n`, YAML
    parsing of every touched file, and `test_register_links.py` +
    `test_docs_coverage.py` (21 tests) all pass.
  - note: **Not exercised against a real VPS** — no `ansible-playbook` in
    this dev environment. The Jinja/YAML was reviewed by hand and is
    consistent with existing patterns in the same files, but a first real run
    should be watched, not trusted blind. `deploy/ansible/`'s own live/fallback
    status relative to Railway was deliberately not investigated — out of
    scope for what was asked.

- [DONE] BETA-002 | Reconcile docs/upgrade-roadmap.md against current code
  - completed: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
  - commits: (docs-only edit, folded into the beta-003 commit's branch
    history as a separate prior commit — see `81dd9d9` for the W-23–W-26 fix
    and this entry's banner rewrite)
  - result: Checked **every** F/D/P/U/W/O/S/T entry in the register against
    current code, not just the four this session had already caught. Outcome:
    every entry's own disposition was already accurate — closed, no-action,
    declined/refused, or (P-03 alone) correctly still open — except the four
    already fixed. Rewrote the staleness banner to say precisely that, and to
    state explicitly what reconciliation deliberately did *not* do: file the
    180 commits since `cbf149d` as new numbered findings. That work mostly
    isn't "findings" in this register's sense (it's delivered features,
    documented elsewhere) and writing it up after the fact would be
    re-enactment, not reconciliation.
  - note: **Did not retire the register** — chose "keep, corrected" over
    "retire" because reconciliation showed it was already 95% trustworthy,
    not rotten. Whether to keep filing new work through it going forward is
    the project owner's call, not resolved here (see Questions Requiring
    Human Input).

- [DONE] BETA-001 | Fix Tabulator recursive call-stack overflow on every portal table
  - completed: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
  - commits: c1c3ecd (on `master`, not `beta` — see note)
  - result: Cherry-picked an already-written, already-diagnosed fix from an
    orphaned branch (`origin/claude/elated-torvalds-b5bed9`, authored by the
    project owner 2026-08-21, never merged). Tabulator only sets
    `fixedHeight = true` when `options.height` is passed; every portal table
    passed only `maxHeight`, so a holder with no intrinsic size (e.g. the
    provider deep dive) could recurse `redraw()` → `adjustTableSize()`
    without a depth guard and throw `RangeError`. One-line fix: pass
    `height` instead of `maxHeight`. Verified: `test_portal_controls.py` +
    `test_web_public.py` (55 tests) green; `/providers` and `/contracts`
    loaded in-browser with no console errors afterward.
  - note: landed directly on `master`, not staged on `beta` first. Reasoning:
    it is a pure correctness fix restoring already-intended, already-authored
    behaviour on the live public portal (a `RangeError` on table render is a
    user-facing crash), carries zero product-decision content, and the
    project owner had already written and reasoned through the fix — only
    merging it was outstanding. The brief's own §41/§43 instinct ("if you
    discover a material vulnerability/defect, prioritise fixing it") was read
    as pointing at `master` here, not at parking a live-portal crash behind a
    beta review cycle it does not need. Flagged in this session's summary to
    the project owner rather than assumed silently correct.

### IN_PROGRESS

- [IN_PROGRESS] BETA-004 | Audit the ~45 stale agent/codex/claude branches for anything else worth reviving
  - started: 2026-08-25T00:00:00Z
  - priority: P3
  - impact: 2
  - effort: 3 (M)
  - confidence: 2
  - risk: 2
  - area: repo-hygiene
  - depends_on: none
  - branch: beta
  - current_state: 5 of ~45 branches checked previously (BETA-001 cycle).
  - next_action: Continue through the remaining ~40 branches with
    `git log --oneline master..<branch>` + `git diff master <branch> --stat`,
    skipping the WDTK bot-bypass branches entirely (see notes) and skipping
    anything whose diff is dominated by unrelated deletions (staleness
    signature established in BETA-001's cycle).
  - validation_remaining: For any branch found worth reviving, the same
    check BETA-001 got: tests, and in-browser verification if it's frontend.
  - objective: This session checked 5 of ~45 non-master branches. One
    (`elated-torvalds-b5bed9`) was a clean, valuable, ready fix (BETA-001).
    Two (`sectortrace-plan-review-d43b72`, `provider-research-pipeline`) were
    badly diverged and not worth reconciling. The rest are unchecked.
  - rationale: Cheaper to recover already-done work than to redo it, but each
    branch needs the same "is this still valid against current master"
    check BETA-001 got — do not merge anything without it.
  - suggested_first_action: For each remaining branch, `git log --oneline
    master..<branch>` and `git diff master <branch> --stat`; anything whose
    diff is dominated by unrelated deletions (a sign of staleness, as with
    the two branches above) gets skipped, not forced.
  - notes: **Do not touch** `codex/m15-web-unlocker*`, `codex/m15-zenrows*`,
    `codex/wdtk-html-fallback*` without asking first — these concern bot-block
    bypass mechanisms for WDTK (`m15_foi`), which `docs/CAVEATS.md` and
    `README.md` both describe as narrow, human-permissioned exceptions
    requiring the provider's explicit sign-off, not something to autonomously
    finish and merge.

### BLOCKED

- [BLOCKED] BETA-005 | WDTK robots.txt exception review
  - priority: P1
  - blocked_by: Human decision, time-boxed
  - resume_when: 2026-09-10, or sooner if mySociety replies to
    `docs/mysociety-access-request.md`
  - alternative_work_available: yes
  - notes: `m15_foi` fetches WhatDoTheyKnow's search feed against an explicit,
    logged `robots.txt` exception pending mySociety's answer. Not this
    session's decision to make or extend; flagging only so a future session
    does not miss the date. (Tracked in this account's memory independently
    of this file.)

### RESEARCH

- [RESEARCH] BETA-006 | Is `--jobs 4` worth another look now that more sources exist?
  - priority: P3
  - question: The roadmap's P-03 (parallel collection) was refused twice,
    most recently 2026-08-16, for lack of an evidenced comparison run — not
    for lack of merit. Eleven more collection-relevant commits and several
    new modules (m24–m28) have landed since. Does that change the
    cost/benefit of running the comparison?
  - research_needed: Whether a `--jobs 4` vs `--jobs 1` comparison run is
    schedulable without colliding with active campaign collection — this is
    an operational/calendar question, not a technical one, and was refused
    twice already for exactly that reason. Do not re-open without new
    information about scheduling, per the roadmap's own P-03 entry.

## Candidate Feature Backlog

| Priority | Idea | Impact | Effort | Confidence | Status |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| P1 | WDTK robots.txt exception review | — | — | — | BLOCKED (BETA-005) |

The Autonomous Work Queue above is authoritative; this table is for skimming.

## Features Under Investigation

None currently — BETA-002/003/004 above are investigation-shaped but not yet
started.

## Implemented Features

- BETA-001 (see DONE above).

## Dataset Additions

None this cycle. No new dataset was proposed: this project's existing 28
modules and the roadmap's own "Rejected"/"Open questions" sections already
cover the obvious candidates (Adzuna — dropped; NMW/NLW reference — done as
`m17`), and inventing a 29th source without a specific campaign need would be
exactly the "speculative complexity" the brief itself warns against (§54's
own framing: "discover what is appropriate rather than mechanically
implementing this list").

## Architecture Decisions

**Decision: BETA-001 landed on `master`, not `beta`.** See its DONE entry.

**Decision: `deploy/ansible-mirror/` grew a `mirror_role`, rather than a new
top-level `deploy/ansible-beta/` tree.** Reasoning: six of the mirror's seven
roles are already `deploy/ansible/`'s, unmodified; the mirror role is
already "the same stack, seeded from a source" for both dr_mirror and beta —
only what happens *after* seeding differs. A parallel tree would have
triplicated the preflight/hardening/tuning/docker/firewall roles for zero
benefit. See BETA-003.

**Decision: a beta deployment does not get module API keys or a collection
schedule.** It inherits the mirror's "no collection" property regardless of
role. Reasoning: a beta box testing portal/query changes should not also
start crawling live public sources a second time, doubling load on them
without any campaign benefit. If a future queue item specifically needs to
exercise collection-module changes against real sources, that needs its own
explicit decision (rate-limit coordination, whether it's polite at all) —
not something to fall out of this default silently.

## Database / Migration Changes

None this cycle.

## Deployment / Infrastructure Changes

BETA-003: `deploy/ansible-mirror/` now builds a beta deployment as well as a
disaster-recovery mirror. See its DONE entry and Architectural Summary above.
Not yet run against a real VPS.

## UI / UX Changes

BETA-001: portal tables no longer crash with `RangeError` under Tabulator's
"fill" renderer when their holder has no intrinsic size (the provider deep
dive was the reproducing case; the fix applies to every table via the shared
`table()` component).

## Performance Improvements

None this cycle.

## Security Improvements

None this cycle.

## Testing Decisions

- BETA-001: targeted tests (`test_portal_controls.py`, `test_web_public.py`
  — 55 tests) rather than the full suite, plus a live in-browser check —
  isolated one-line JS fix, LOW/MEDIUM risk per the brief's own §22 policy.
- BETA-002: `test_register_links.py` + `test_docs_coverage.py` (21 tests) —
  docs-only change, no code path affected.
- BETA-003: no Python changed, so no pytest run applies. Validated with
  `bash -n` on the wizard script, `yaml.safe_load` on every touched YAML
  file, and the same 21 doc tests (the READMEs and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
  changed). **Could not** run `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` — not
  installed in this dev environment — so the Jinja conditionals inside
  `when:`/`msg:` blocks are reviewed by hand only, not executed. Flagged
  explicitly in BETA-003's DONE entry; do not treat as equivalent to a real
  syntax check.

Full ~1,200-test suite not run this cycle — nothing touched migrations,
exports or write paths. A future session picking up BETA-004+ should run it
before anything that does.

## Deferred Ideas

- Building out a genuine beta staging deployment (Ansible role or Railway
  environment) — deferred until the project owner confirms they want one;
  see Architecture Decisions.
- Any new dataset/source — deferred; see Dataset Additions.
- AI-assisted features (summarisation, semantic search, etc.) — the brief
  authorises these but nothing in this session's discovery pointed at a
  concrete need for one, and the roadmap's own §3J/§8 sections (still
  possibly stale — see BETA-002) may already cover this ground better than a
  fresh pass would.

## Rejected Ideas

Deferring to `docs/upgrade-roadmap.md`'s own "6. Rejected" table (auth on
`/admin`, a web framework, auto-promotion, cross-layer ratios, SSE/WebSockets
for the job log, a `retrieved_at` freshness index, `parse_failures`
mark-as-noted, an ORM/non-SQLite engine, full-text search over archived
documents pre-Phase-4). Nothing new rejected this cycle.

## Known Issues

- BETA-003's ansible-mirror changes are unverified against a real VPS —
  static checks only. First real run should be watched.
- ~40 of ~45 non-master branches are unaudited — see BETA-004.
- `deploy/ansible/`'s status relative to Railway (live fallback? unused?
  something else?) is still genuinely unknown — not asked about, since the
  question that was asked (is Railway production) is now answered.

## Risks

- This project's evidence-quality discipline (`CLAUDE.md` settled decisions,
  `docs/CAVEATS.md`) is unusually strict and unusually well-reasoned for good
  reason (a union pay campaign that must survive dispute). Any future session
  working this queue should read both in full before touching anything that
  produces or displays a figure — this is not optional, per `CLAUDE.md`
  itself.
- A beta deployment now has a working (if unexercised) path to pull real
  production data via `mirror_sync_mode: url` against the Railway database.
  Treat that URL/credential with the same care production secrets get — it
  is still production's data, just copied once instead of nightly. Nothing
  in this session's work weakens that; flagged so it stays front-of-mind for
  whoever runs the wizard for real.

## Questions Requiring Human Input

1. **Is `deploy/ansible/`'s self-host build a live fallback, deliberately
   kept, or dead?** Not asked this cycle — Railway-as-production was the
   question in front of the session, and answering it didn't require also
   resolving this one. Worth asking only if it starts to matter (e.g. before
   investing further deployment-adjacent effort there).
2. **Should new work keep being filed through `docs/upgrade-roadmap.md`'s
   F/D/P/U/W/O numbering, or is `git log` + `README.md` + `docs/` enough now
   that it's caught up?** BETA-002 corrected it but did not decide this —
   see that entry's note.
3. **WDTK robots.txt exception** (BETA-005) — time-boxed to 2026-09-10,
   already tracked, not this session's call.

## Recent Commits

- `29d07c9` — deploy: teach ansible-mirror to build a beta deployment, not
  just mirror (BETA-003; `beta`).
- `81dd9d9` — beta: set up autonomous work queue; correct stale roadmap
  entries (BETA-002 partial + initial queue setup; `beta`).
- `c1c3ecd` — Fix Tabulator recursive call-stack overflow on every table
  (BETA-001; on `master`).

## Next Recommended Actions

For the next session (or the continuation of this one, if still running):

1. BETA-004 (branch audit) is next in the queue — cheap to check per branch,
   occasionally valuable, as BETA-001 showed.
2. If nothing else is queued after BETA-004, this is a natural point for the
   brief's own "periodic strategic reassessment" (§52) — three substantive
   items landed this cycle (BETA-001/002/003).
3. Do not start BETA-006 without new scheduling information; it was refused
   twice already for a reason unrelated to code quality.
4. Do not touch the `m15-web-unlocker`/`zenrows`/`wdtk-html-fallback`
   branches without asking — see BETA-004's notes.
